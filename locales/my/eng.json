		"tab1_content1": "<p>FIJI Mining offers Bitcoin mining without buying any equipment. Instead, you are buying mining packages from our data centers located in the US, Canada, and Europe.</p><p>FIJI Mining was created to allow professionals and newcomers similar access to the same quality resources as the industrial miners to enable effective and efficient mining. Our cooperation with the industry leaders and access to the newest and most advanced technologies in the industry, quickly made us one of the world leading mining services.</p><p>To join FIJI Mining, you must be able to pay with either Bitcoin or Ethereum. We do not accept anything other than Bitcoin and Ethereum, so depending on the country you live in, you must convert your currency into Bitcoin or Ethereum and then use the Bitcoin or Ethereum to sign up for FIJI Mining. We price everything in USD to have a standard price for our products, but we do not accept USD or any other fiat currency.</p><p>To start, you will need to pay a one-time $99 membership fee that will give you lifetime access to our platform. As a member, you'll be able to purchase any of our mining packages and participate in all other opportunities that we provide in the future.</p>",
		"tab1_content2": "<p>The maintenance fee covers all costs related to mining, including, but not limited to:<ul class='answer-list'><li>Electricity costs</li><li>Cooling systems</li><li>Maintenance work</li><li>Hosting services</li></ul></p>",
		"tab1_content3": "<p>Please contact us at support@FIJImining.net</p>",
		"tab1_content4": "<p>We have a strict NO REFUND policy due to the speed at which our compensation structure and mining package earnings are paid out. In most cases, you cannot get a refund for any reason unless there is an apparent mistake on our end. Also, this refund request must happen within the first 72 hours of payment or before three full pay cycles are paid out. If you make a refund request after this time, we will not be able to honor it.</p>",
		"tab1_content5": "<p>Mining equipment is the term used for specialized computer hardware that has been customized to run hashing functions. These machines can be strung together and plugged into the Bitcoin network. The mining equipment is an ASIC chip that is designed to handle hashing functions. The rest of the 'equipment' is used to cool the chip and provide power to it.</p><p>We are continually buying new equipment to leverage our purchasing power on behalf of all FIJI Members. Most of the miners we purchase are from Bitmain, which is the #1 seller of mining gear worldwide. We have built a relationship with them that allows us to get preferred pricing and deploy racks of new servers. Additionally, we can liquidate some of the older mining equipment with Bitmain through their secondary market, and this allows us to maximize profits.</p>",
		"tab1_content6": "<p>There are many different options available for you to set up your wallet and the decision is similar to deciding which bank you want to use. Most wallets offer the same services, and they are free to use, so you need to pick one that suits your needs. There are also options to have wallets stored on your computer or even offline in the form of paper wallets. Security is the most important thing when choosing a wallet. Here are some popular 3rd party wallets:</p><ul class='answer-list'><li>Blockchain - THE BEST and our favorite!</li><li>Xapo - Solid security, a global solution and provides a vault.</li><li>Coinbase - The biggest wallet.</li><li>BitStamp - Best for EU bank wires and EU customers.</li><li>Bitcoin.org - Another excellent resource for choosing a wallet.</li></ul>",
		"tab2_content1": "<p>In order to restore your password:<ol><li>Click on “LOGIN”</li><li>Click on the “Forgot username or password?” link</li><li>Enter your email</li><li>Complete the CAPTCHA</li><li>Click “Send”</li></ol></p><p>You will receive an email with further step by step instructions</p>",
		"tab2_content2": "<p>The address will be different for each cryptocurrency (BTC / ETH). Please make sure you have the correct address saved before making a withdrawal request. Each wallet will have a separate area to input and save your address.</p><p>To make a withdrawal request, you'll need to enter the destination address, withdrawal address, amount to send, and OTP Authorization Code.</p><p>To prevent an “Insufficient Funds Error,” please make sure you are not going over the limit of what you currently have in the credit wallet. With Bitcoin, there is a 0.002 BTC fee that must be accounted for on withdrawals less than 2 BTC.</p>",
		"tab2_content3": "<p>Members’ withdrawal requests are combined to optimize and increase the speed of transactions.</p>",
		"tab2_content4": "<p>To set up your Google Authenticator (GA) App:<ol><li>Log in and go to your My Profile section under the My Account tab.</li><li>Scroll down to the bottom of the page, and change Disable to Enable.</li><li>A QR code will appear. You will need to scan this code with your smartphone or app-capable device to receive your Google Authenticator code.</li><li>The Google Authenticator code on your device will be used to access your account.</li><li>The app will confirm that the time has been synced, and you should now be able to use your verification codes to sign in. The synchronization will only affect the internal time of your Google Authenticator app and will not change your device's Date & time settings.</li></ol></p>",
		"tab2_content5": "<p>When you send Bitcoin from your wallet to the BTC address provided on the invoice, the transaction must be verified by the network six times before it is confirmed and accepted. This process typically takes anywhere from 10 minutes to 1 hour. Once we receive the 6th confirmation, your invoice will be marked as paid and commissions will follow. In some cases, it might take 3-4 hours to get six confirmations if you are using a wallet that allows you to set a mining fee to zero. If you set the mining fee high (standard is .0001 BTC), you will get confirmations quickly.</p>",
		"tab2_content6": "<p>If you do not see the payment reflected on the account, your payment to the invoice may be short. The exact amount of Bitcoin will need to be paid to avoid any errors. If you find that your payment is insufficient, you will need to send in a support ticket for further assistance.</p>",
		"tab2_content7": "<p>Any commissions made from a mining package you do not own will be sent to held commissions. For example, if you own hash power from Mining Package 1 but not Mining Packages 2, 3, or 4, then the commissions from your downline that come from Mining Packages 2, 3, and 4 are sent to a held commissions section and will not credit your wallet.</p><p>If you have held commissions accumulating for a mining package, you must first purchase that full package to receive those commissions. Alternatively, if you enable the “Automatic Package Upgrade” option, then the accumulating BTC will stay there until there is enough Bitcoin value to make a full package purchase of that particular mining package.</p><p>Example: If you are accumulating held commissions in Mining Package 2, a $3000 value would need to be exceeded before a full mining package is automatically purchased. From this point, any future commissions would go directly into the credit wallet.</p>",
		"tab3_content1": "<p>Your daily earnings depend on many unpredictable factors such as block reward, mining difficulty, and blocks mined. However, we assure you that all mined Bitcoins are automatically added to your balance each day. Please note that because our payout is based on overall network hash rate, we recommend all of our members to do their research and their own earning calculations.</p>",
		"tab3_content2": "<p>We pay mining earnings every day! However, when you first purchase any mining package, you will not start earning Bitcoins for ten days. This short preparatory time not only allows us to stabilize the payout, but it also gives us time to purchase and install new equipment. After these initial ten days, you begin earning bitcoin daily for 1,000 days (the contract term).</p><p>Maintenance Fees & Repurchases: Each day you will earn a percentage of Bitcoin mined that will be instantly available for you to withdraw. You will also see another portion automatically held to cover maintenance fees and for purchasing new mining equipment. There is a minimum percentage for each package, and these holdover amounts are automatically redeemed in the form of partial hash repurchases. You will see your total hash power increase for 1,000 days as you pay back a percentage each day.</p>",
		"tab3_content3": "<p>Newly mined Bitcoins are credited to your balance once per day for the previous mining day.</p><p>Our minimum withdrawal amount is 0.005 BTC. You can request a withdrawal at any time.</p>",
		"tab3_content4": "<p>Mining starts automatically at 00:00 UTC. Mined Bitcoins are credited automatically to the member’s credit wallet once a day for the previous mining day.</p>",
		"tab3_content5": "<p>The number of bitcoins that can be mined and circulated is limited. As more miners join the network, mining difficulty gets increased and requires additional time for mining. The amount of Bitcoins credited to your balance each day is also influenced by the BTC/USD exchange rate, as the maintenance cost of the contract pays in USD. We'll also need to sell some part of mined bitcoins due to the Coindesk BPI daily closing price for its covering. Thus, the higher the BTC price, the less you need to pay for the maintenance and the more you’ll earn.</p>",
		"tab3_content6": "<p>We can guarantee that you will only receive newly mined Bitcoins. You can check the age of your Bitcoins on blockchain.info by putting in the transaction ID that you receive after your withdrawal from our service. Thus, everyone can be confident that we are indeed mining Bitcoins and that we are not an elaborate Ponzi scheme.</p>",
		"tab3_content7": "<p>It is crucial to understand that we DO NOT guarantee that any mining package will have a set return. You will never hear us make any claims about how much you will earn from a mining package because it’s impossible to know. Bitcoin mining is very complex, and with the difficulty level continually moving up every ten days and new hashing power always entering the space, there is no way anyone can accurately predict an ROI (especially with our business model that requires repurchases and maintenance fees).</p><p>NOTE: If you find a company offering you a set return (especially if they claim to be cloud mining and provide 100% or more), there is a high probability they are a Ponzi scheme. Real hardware actually backs some cloud miners, but their power is virtual and therefore very hard to track. The sad reality is you will never know if a cloud mining company is actually mining, so we recommend you steer clear unless they are very transparent. We are NOT a cloud mining company. Everything we have can be verified!</p>",
		"tab3_content8": "<p>When you purchase a mining package, it will not start earning right away. It will begin after a ten-day holding period for confirmation and placement. After the holding period, your hash power will begin earning you Bitcoin daily. The contract duration of each mining package is 1,000 days and will terminate at that time unless you renew your contract.</p>"
