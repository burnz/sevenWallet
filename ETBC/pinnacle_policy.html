		<h2>Pinnacle Mining Policy</h2>
		<h5>FinCEN</h5>
		<p>
			FinCEN is America's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulator.
			FinCEN aims to contribute towards a financial environment hostile to money laundering,
			major crime and tax evasion. Pinnacle Mining is committed to helping achieve this same goal
			within the cryptocurrency landscape. 
		</p>
		<h5>What is Money Laundering?</h5>
		<p>
			Money laundering is the process in which the proceeds of crime are transformed into
			ostensibly legitimate money or other assets. However, in a number of legal and regulatory
			systems the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial crime,
			and sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system (involving things
			such as securities, digital currencies, credit cards, and traditional currency), including terrorism
			financing, tax evasion and evading of international sanctions. 
		</p>
		<h5>Pinnacle Mining Policy</h5>
		<p>
			Pinnacle Mining does due diligence when it comes to our customers and we do our best to implement as much
			of the know your customer (KYC) reporting requirements as can. Pinnacle Mining wants to see a
			safe and secure crypto currency ecosystem all over the world that's free of money laundering, criminal
			activity, and terrorist financing. 
		</p>
